## Introduction

In this vignette we present how functions from this package can be used to get intersections between cohorts. This can be useful, for instance, if we want to identify patients with previous conditions. 

The PatientProfiles package is designed to work with data in the OMOP CDM format, so our first step is to create a reference to the data using the DBI and CDMConnector packages. The connection to a Postgres database would look like:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(DBI)
library(CDMConnector)

# The input arguments provided are for illustrative purposes only and do not provide access to any database.

con <- DBI::dbConnect(RPostgres::Postgres(),
  dbname = "omop_cdm",
  host = "10.80.192.00",
  user = "user_name",
  password = "user_pasword"
)

cdm <- CDMConnector::cdm_from_con(con,
  cdm_schema = "main",
  write_schema = "main",
  cohort_tables = "cohort_example"
)
```

In this vignette we will work with simulated data generated by the `mockPatientProfiles()` function provided in this package, which mimics a database formatted in OMOP. 

```{r, message= FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(PatientProfiles)
library(duckdb)
library(dplyr)

cdm <- mockPatientProfiles(
  patient_size = 1000,
  drug_exposure_size = 1000
)
```

In this mock dataset there are the following cohort tables:
```{r, message= FALSE, warning=FALSE}
cdm$cohort1 %>%
  glimpse()

cdm$cohort2 %>%
  glimpse()
```
## Example: addCohortIntersectFlag and addCohortIntersectCount functions
`addCohortIntersectFlag()`: adds a binary column indicate intersection with a cohort in a time frame.

Suppose cohort2 with definition_id = 1 contains stroke occurrences. If we want to exclude patients from cohort1 who had a stroke event in the last 180 days before entering the cohort, we can use the `addCohortIntersectFlag()` like this:

```{r, message= FALSE, warning=FALSE}
cohort1WashOut <- cdm$cohort1 %>%
  addCohortIntersectFlag(
    targetCohortTable = "cohort2",
    window = list(c(-180, -1)),
    targetCohortId = 1,
  ) %>%
  filter(cohort_1_m180_to_m1 == 0)

cohort1WashOut %>%
  glimpse()
```

`addCohortIntersectCount()`: adds a column where it indicates the number of intersections in a certain time window.

We can use the function to count the number of occurrences of an event of interest in different time windows before entering the study population. For example, we can look at the number of strokes in the 0-90 day, 90-365 day, and all prior history windows:

```{r, message= FALSE, warning=FALSE}
cohort1StrokeCounts <- cdm$cohort1 %>%
  addCohortIntersectCount(
    targetCohortTable = "cohort2",
    window = list(c(-Inf, -366), c(-365, -181), c(-180, -1)),
    targetCohortId = 1
  )

cohort1StrokeCounts %>%
  glimpse()
```

Let us comment on the `targetEndDate` functionality found in `addCohortIntersectCount()` and `addCohortIntersectFlag()` functions. In both of them, there are three reference dates which can be specified:
* `indexDate`: date from the primary cohort table, which contains the individuals for which we want to find the intersection events
* `targetStartDate`: date from the events table used for the intersection
* `targetEndDate`: date from the events table used for the intersection

By default, `indexDate = cohort_start_date`, `targetStartDate = cohort_start_date` and `targetEndDate = cohort_end_date`. This means that, if we are intersecting two cohorts and specify `window = c(-30,-1)`, we will get any events from the intersecting cohort happening up to 30 days previous to the cohort start date of the main cohort. Namely:

```{r}
# This will be our "main" cohort
cohort1 <- dplyr::tibble(
  cohort_definition_id = 1,
  subject_id = c("1", "2"),
  cohort_start_date = c(
    as.Date("2010-03-01"),
    as.Date("2012-03-01")
  ),
  cohort_end_date = c(
    as.Date("2015-01-01"),
    as.Date("2016-03-01")
  )
)

# This is the cohort with the events we are interested in
cohort2 <- dplyr::tibble(
  cohort_definition_id = 1,
  subject_id = c("1", "1", "1", "2"),
  cohort_start_date = c(
    as.Date("2010-03-03"),
    as.Date("2010-02-27"),
    as.Date("2010-03-25"),
    as.Date("2013-01-03")
  ),
  cohort_end_date = c(
    as.Date("2010-03-03"),
    as.Date("2010-02-27"),
    as.Date("2012-03-25"),
    as.Date("2013-01-03")
  )
)

observation_period <- dplyr::tibble(
  observation_period_id = 1:2,
  person_id = c(1,2),
  observation_period_start_date = as.Date(c("1990-01-01", "1995-08-16")),
  observation_period_end_date = as.Date(c("2025-01-01", "2030-08-16")),
  period_type_concept_id = 0
)

cdm <- mockPatientProfiles(
  observation_period = observation_period,
  cohort1 = cohort1,
  cohort2 = cohort2
)

cdm$cohort1 <- cdm$cohort1 %>% addCohortIntersectCount(targetCohortTable = "cohort2", window = list(c(-30, -1)))
cdm$cohort1
```

We get one event for `subject_id = 1`, the one starting and ending on the `2010-02-27`, which is within the window before the index date `2010-03-01`. The individual `subject_id = 2` does not have any of the intersecting events of interest.

Note that, with the specifications by default, we pick one event (the second one), which is not incident in the window of interest, but overlaps it. Indeed, as the event start date is before the index date in the main cohort and the end date is after it, it is regarded as intersecting.

However, we could be interested in events starting in the window of interest. To only screen for those, we can set `targetEndDate = cohort_start_date`.


```{r, message= FALSE, warning=FALSE}
cdm$cohort1 <- cdm$cohort1 %>% addCohortIntersectCount(targetCohortTable = "cohort2", window = list(c(-30, -1)), targetEndDate = "cohort_start_date")
cdm$cohort1
```

Now we do not pick the event which starts on `2010-01-25`, which is more than 30 days before the index date of the main cohort, `2010-03-01`. 

The input `targetEndDate` allows, therefore, to select whether to perform the intersection in an "overlapping" or "incident" way.

As for the functions `addCohortIntersectDays()` and `addCohortIntersectDate()`, they need a specific date in the target cohort to calculate time outputs. Therefore, only `targetDate` needs to be specified, which is set to "cohort_start_date" by default.


## Example: addCohortIntersectDays function

`addCohortIntersectDays()`: adds a new column that indicates the number of days in which the subject intersects with another cohort during a specific time frame. If there are multiple intersections, only one will be computed, either the first or the latest one in the time window ("order" argument).

The function can be utilized to calculate the time to the event of interest, such as time until the first stroke after index date. If the patient did not experience the event, the function will return NA.

```{r, message= FALSE, warning=FALSE}
cohort1TimeTo <- cdm$cohort1 %>%
  addCohortIntersectDays(
    targetCohortTable = "cohort2",
    targetCohortId = 1,
    order = "first"
  )

cohort1TimeTo %>%
  glimpse()
```


## Example: addCohortIntersectDate function

`addCohortIntersectDate()`: appends a column containing the start date of cohorts that are present in a certain window.

This function can be handy in obtaining the date of the next occurrence of a specific event. For instance, suppose cohort1 comprises patients who enrolled when they received their first vaccine dose. We could use this function to obtain the date of their second dose if we have a cohort with vaccine records (e.g. cohort2): 

```{r, message= FALSE, warning=FALSE}
cohort1NextEvent <- cdm$cohort1 %>%
  addCohortIntersectDate(
    targetCohortTable = "cohort2",
    order = "first",
    targetCohortId = 1,
    window = c(1, Inf)
  )

cohort1NextEvent %>%
  glimpse()
```


Please note that the new columns added to the table (for all function presented) will have the format cohort_"cohort_definition_id"_ "time window". If the window number is negative, a "m" will be added in front to indicate it and no sign will be added to positive numbers.

## Example: addCohortIntersect function

`addCohortIntersect()`: Compute the intersect with a target cohort, you can compute the number of occurrences, a flag of presence, a certain date and/or the days difference.

We can use the function to compute all the intersect information with a target cohort. By default it will return output from `addCohortIntersectCount()`, `addCohortIntersectFlag()`, `addCohortIntersectDate()` and `addCohortIntersectDays()` in a time frame. Use this function if you want to append all the intersection information with this function. For information on what these function does, you can read above example.

```{r, message= FALSE, warning=FALSE}
cohort1CohortIntersect <- cdm$cohort1 %>%
  addCohortIntersect(
    targetCohortTable = "cohort2",
    order = "first",
    targetCohortId = 1,
    window = c(1, Inf)
  )
cohort1CohortIntersect %>%
  glimpse()
```

We can also control which columns to append to your data by using the flag, count, date and time options in the function, if we do not want everything. For example if we only want the cohort count and flag we can use below example.

```{r, message= FALSE, warning=FALSE}
cohort1CohortIntersect <- cdm$cohort1 %>%
  addCohortIntersect(
    targetCohortTable = "cohort2",
    order = "first",
    targetCohortId = 1,
    window = c(1, Inf),
    flag = TRUE,
    count = TRUE,
    date = FALSE,
    days = FALSE
  )
cohort1CohortIntersect %>%
  glimpse()
```
