\arguments{
\item{x}{table containing the individual for which the overlap indicator to
be attached as extra columns}

\item{cdm}{cdm containing the tables}

\item{tableName}{name of the cohort that we want to check for overlap}

\item{value}{value of interest to add: it can be count, flag, date or time}

\item{filterVariable}{the variable that we are going to use to filter (e.g.
cohort_definition_id)}

\item{filterId}{the value of filterVariable that we are interested in, it can
be a vector}

\item{idName}{the name of each filterId, must have same length than
filterId}

\item{window}{window to consider events of}

\item{indexDate}{date of reference in table x}

\item{targetStartDate}{date of reference in cohort table, either for start
(in overlap) or on its own (for incidence)}

\item{targetEndDate}{date of reference in cohort table, either for end
(overlap) or NULL (if incidence)}

\item{order}{last or first date to use for date/time calculations}

\item{nameStyle}{naming of the added column or columns, should include
required parameters}

\item{tablePrefix}{The stem for the permanent tables that will
be created. If NULL, temporary tables will be used throughout.}

table with added columns with overlap information
