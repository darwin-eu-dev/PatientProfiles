\item{ageGroup}{List of age groups to be added.}

\item{ageDefaultMonth}{Month of the year assigned to individuals with missing
month of birth. By default: 1.}

\item{ageDefaultDay}{day of the month assigned to individuals with missing
day of birth. By default: 1.}

\item{ageImposeMonth}{Whether the month of the date of birth will be
considered as missing for all the individuals.}

\item{ageImposeDay}{Whether the day of the date of birth will be considered
