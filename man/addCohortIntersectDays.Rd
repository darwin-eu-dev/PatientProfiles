\arguments{
\item{x}{Table with individuals in the cdm.}

\item{targetCohortTable}{Cohort table to.}

\item{targetCohortId}{Cohort IDs of interest from the other cohort table. If
NULL, all cohorts will be used with a days variable added for each
cohort of interest.}

\item{indexDate}{Variable in x that contains the date to compute the
intersection.}

\item{censorDate}{whether to censor overlap events at a specific date
or a column date of x.}

\item{targetDate}{Date of interest in the other cohort table. Either
cohort_start_date or cohort_end_date.}

\item{order}{date to use if there are multiple records for an
individual during the window of interest. Either first or last.}

\item{window}{Window of time to identify records relative to the indexDate.
Records outside of this time period will be ignored.}

\item{nameStyle}{naming of the added column or columns, should include
