\arguments{
\item{result}{A summariseOverlapCohort result.}

\item{type}{Type of desired formatted table, possibilities: "gt",
"flextable", "tibble".}

\item{formatEstimateName}{Named list of estimate name's to join, sorted by
computation order. Indicate estimate_name's between <...>.}

\item{header}{A vector containing which elements should go into the header
in order. Allowed are: `cdm_name`, `group`, `strata`, `additional`,
`variable`, `estimate`, `settings`.}

\item{split}{A vector containing the name-level groups to split ("group",
"strata", "additional"), or an empty character vector to not split.}

\item{groupColumn}{Column to use as group labels.}

\item{minCellCount}{Counts below which results will be clouded.}

\item{excludeColumns}{Columns to drop from the output table.}

\item{.options}{Named list with additional formatting options.
PatientProfiles::optionsTableCohortOverlap() shows allowed arguments and
their default values.}

A formatted table of the summariseOverlapCohort result.
